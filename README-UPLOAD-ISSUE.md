# ⚠️ WordPress ZIP Upload Issue - SOLVED

## 🔴 The Problem

You're getting this error when uploading the theme ZIP:
```
File type not allowed for security reasons.
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

This is **NOT a theme problem**. It's a **hosting/server restriction** that blocks ZIP uploads for security reasons. Many shared hosting providers enable this by default.

## ✅ THE SOLUTION: Use FTP Upload

**Stop trying to upload via WordPress!** Use FTP instead - it works 100% of the time.

## 📦 What You Need

### 1. FTP-Ready Theme Folder
**Location**: `c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\mypowerly-theme-FTP-READY`

### 2. FTP Credentials
Contact your hosting provider for:
- FTP Host (e.g., ftp.yourdomain.com)
- Username

- Port (usually 21)

### 3. FTP Client
Download **FileZilla** (free): https://filezilla-project.org/
